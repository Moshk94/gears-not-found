 - Control all towers with the mouse - towers will automatically shoot at mouse location.
 - Click a tower in between rounds to open up upgrade menu.
 - Tower's will lock up after **40.4** seconds, preventing the tower from moving, the tower however will still shoot in the direction it's facing.

Enemies
 - Enemies will follow the highlighted path.
 - Enemies will take the shortest path to the end goal.
 - If there is no valid path, the enemies will break through towers to reach the goal.
 - There is a bonus round every 10 levels - defeat the bonus enemy to get cash/life bonuses. The amount of bonus you get is based on the damage done. The tower's timer will not decrease during bonus rounds. No lives can be lost on bonus rounds.
